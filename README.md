# Compare classification methods

This is a comparasion of different classification methods.

5 methods of classifying certain dataset is tested here with simple monolithic Python + Streamlit app.

Classification for spam dataset is based on 2 classes:

* spam
* not spam


Classifiaction for mushroom dataset is based on 2 classes:

* poisonus
* not poisonus

It does not change the data, just perform analisys on given and preprocesses dataset.

Based on:

* [Enron Spam Dataset](https://github.com/MWiechmann/enron_spam_data)
* [Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)
